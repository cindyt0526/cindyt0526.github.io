      <p>
        Hello! My name is Cindy Tang and I am currently studying for my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science
        and a certificate in Management and Information Systems at Temple University. I am very excited to learn
        more about computer science and to collaborate with others in order to further my knowledge in this profession.
        Currently I enjoy coding and learning Java and C. I wish to find more experiences in this field and I am very
        open to any opportunities that are laid out for me. If you would like to reach out my email is at the bottom
        of the page and my LinkedIn is at the top of the page!
